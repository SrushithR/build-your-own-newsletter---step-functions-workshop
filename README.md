## Mastering AWS Step Functions: Build and Manage Your Own Newsletter

### Link to the documentation - https://srushithr.github.io/build-your-own-newsletter-step-functions-workshop/

### Abstract:

In this hands-on workshop, participants will learn how to design, build, and manage a fully automated newsletter system using AWS Step Functions. By the end of the workshop, attendees will have the skills to create sophisticated workflows that can handle complex business logic, scale efficiently, and integrate directly with other AWS services.

### Outline:

#### Introduction to AWS Step Functions

- Overview of AWS Step Functions and their importance in orchestrating microservices.
- Key concepts: states, transitions, and the state machine.
- Designing your first simple workflow.
- Understanding Standard vs. Express Workflows

#### Input and Output Processing

- How to manage input and output data within your workflows.
- Using JSONPath to extract, transform, and pass data between states.
- Best practices for managing large payloads and ensuring data integrity.
  
#### Direct Integration with AWS Services

- Learn how to leverage Step Functions' direct integration with AWS services, focusing on sending emails via Amazon Simple Email Service (SES).
- Explore different ways to trigger email notifications within your workflow.

#### Scaling with the Map State

- Leveraging the Map state to process large datasets in parallel.
- Real-world scenarios where the Map state can optimize your workflows.
- Hands-on example: processing and sending personalized emails to a large subscriber list.

#### Implementing the Callback Pattern

- Using the callback pattern to pause and resume workflows.
- Handling asynchronous tasks by integrating with external systems or human intervention.
- Hands-on example: introducing manual approval step in the newsletter workflow.

#### Mastering Built-in Retry Mechanisms

- Understanding AWS Step Functions' built-in retry and error handling capabilities.
- Designing robust workflows that can handle failures gracefully.
- Practical examples to demonstrate retry logic and error handling.

#### [Bonus] Scheduling Notifications with EventBridge

- Integrating EventBridge with Step Functions to schedule and automate your newsletter sends.
- Setting up cron jobs and event rules to trigger workflows at specific times.
- Best practices for managing scheduled events and ensuring timely delivery.

Prerequisites:

1. Basic understanding of AWS services (IAM, S3, Lambda, SES).
2. Familiarity with JSON and the AWS Management Console.
3. AWS account with permissions to use Step Functions, EventBridge, SES, and Lambda.
